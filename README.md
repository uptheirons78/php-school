# PHP SCHOOL
This repository want to be a personal log on my PHP learning journey (even though I know a little bit of this fantastic language, I want to dive deeper into it).
### Day 4
SQL day here! A lot of people really dislike working with databases and their languages, both SQL or NO-SQL, like MongoDB. I am not one of them and want to learn as much as possible about SQL. I have installed MySQL Workbench a known Database Design and Modelling tool for SQL Database Development as required and suggested in "PHP and MYSQL: Novice to Ninja". Not so difficult to use, even though I always used before PHPMyAdmin.
In this lesson I read about the basics of SQL and its most used commands: CREATE, DROP, INSERT INTO `dbname` (colname, colname) VALUES (colvalue, colvalue), SELECT * FROM `dbname`, the importance of backticks in SQL, SELECT `colname`, `colname` FROM `dbname`, SELECT `colname`, `colname`, LEFT(`colname`,20) FROM `dbname`, SELECT COUNT(`colname`) FROM `dbname`, SELECT `colname` FROM `dbname` WHERE `colname` LIKE "%programmer%", UPDATE `colname` SET `colname` = `newvalue` WHERE conditions, DELETE FROM `tableName` WHERE conditions.
### Day 3
I focused a lot on a chapter about "include" and files structure in any good php project. I learned about obteining current path url with built in __DIR__ function, instead of using classic relative path, just to avoid any kind of issues from users intended to hack it. Also learned about controller and templates in php. I think I need to brush it up later in the course and also find a good tutorial on Youtube about this argument. 
### Day 2
Today I worked on arrays, their basic methods (push, pop, shift, unshift) and on users interactions using forms and inputs. I learned about $_GET and $_POST and the importance to use htmlspecialchars() to avoid any kind of malicious scripts from the URL paramenters.
### Day 1
Using a book from SitePoint "PHP and MySQL: Novice to Ninja 6th Edition" I'm starting today 31 Ago 2018 to study deeper PHP. Today just a little brush up on VARIABLES, OPERATORS, COMMENTS, STATEMENTS and LOOPS. The language is very similar to JS so it is not very difficult for anyone who already know the first.
