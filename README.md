# PHP SCHOOL
This repository want to be a personal log on my PHP learning journey (even though I know a little bit of this fantastic language, I want to dive deeper into it).
### Day 1
Using a book from SitePoint "PHP and MySQL: Novice to Ninja 6th Edition" I'm starting today 31 Ago 2018 to study deeper PHP. Today just a little brush up on VARIABLES, OPERATORS, COMMENTS, STATEMENTS and LOOPS. The language is very similar to JS so it is not very difficult for anyone who already know the first.
