# PHP SCHOOL
This repository want to be a personal log on my PHP learning journey (even though I know a little bit of this fantastic language, I want to dive deeper into it).
### Day 2
Today I worked on arrays, their basic methods (push, pop, shift, unshift) and on users interactions using forms and inputs. I learned about $_GET and $_POST and the importance to use htmlspecialchars() to avoid any kind of malicious scripts from the URL paramenters.
### Day 1
Using a book from SitePoint "PHP and MySQL: Novice to Ninja 6th Edition" I'm starting today 31 Ago 2018 to study deeper PHP. Today just a little brush up on VARIABLES, OPERATORS, COMMENTS, STATEMENTS and LOOPS. The language is very similar to JS so it is not very difficult for anyone who already know the first.
